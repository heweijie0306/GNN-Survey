        "# Graph RAG with Milvus Vector Database\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "### What You'll Learn\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates an innovative approach to **Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** that combines the power of knowledge graphs with vector databases to dramatically improve question-answering performance, especially for complex multi-hop queries. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to build a Graph RAG system that can answer questions requiring multiple logical steps and relationship traversals.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Problem: Limitations of Traditional RAG\n",
        "Traditional RAG systems, while powerful, struggle with:\n",
        "- **Multi-hop questions**: Queries requiring multiple logical steps (e.g., \"What contribution did the son of Euler's teacher make?\")\n",
        "- **Complex entity relationships**: Understanding how different entities connect and relate to each other\n",
        "- **Context fragmentation**: Important relationships may be scattered across different text passages\n",
        "- **Semantic gaps**: Simple similarity search may miss logically relevant but semantically distant information\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Solution: Graph RAG with Vector Database\n",
        "This notebook presents a **unified approach** that achieves Graph RAG capabilities using **only a vector database** (Milvus), eliminating the need for separate graph databases while maintaining superior performance. Here's what makes this approach special:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Innovation**: Instead of storing explicit graph structures, we embed entities and relationships as vectors and use intelligent retrieval and expansion techniques to reconstruct graph-like reasoning paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Benefits\n",
        "1. **Simplified Architecture**: Single vector database instead of vector DB + graph DB combination\n",
        "2. **Superior Multi-hop Performance**: Handles complex queries requiring multiple relationship traversals\n",
        "3. **Scalable**: Leverages Milvus's distributed architecture for billion-scale deployments\n",
        "4. **Cost-effective**: Reduces infrastructure complexity and operational overhead\n",
        "5. **Flexible**: Works with any text corpus - just extract entities and relationships\n",
        "\n",
        "### Methodology Overview\n",
        "Our approach consists of four main stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Offline Data Preparation**\n",
        "   - Extract entities and relationships (triplets) from your text corpus\n",
        "   - Create three vector collections: entities, relationships, and passages\n",
        "   - Build adjacency mappings between entities and relationships\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Query-time Retrieval**\n",
        "   - Retrieve similar entities and relationships using vector similarity search\n",
        "   - Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify query entities\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Subgraph Expansion**\n",
        "   - Expand retrieved entities/relationships to their neighborhood using adjacency matrices\n",
        "   - Support multi-degree expansion (1-hop, 2-hop neighbors)\n",
        "   - Merge results from both entity and relationship expansion paths\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **LLM Reranking**\n",
        "   - Use large language models to intelligently filter and rank candidate relationships\n",
        "   - Apply Chain-of-Thought reasoning to select most relevant relationships\n",
        "   - Return final passages for answer generation\n",
        "\n",
        "### Architecture Diagram\n",
        "The following diagram illustrates the complete workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques/blob/main/images/graph_rag_with_milvus_1.png?raw=1)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why This Works**: By representing both entities and relationships as vectors, we can leverage semantic similarity for initial retrieval, then use graph-theoretical expansion to discover indirect relationships, and finally apply LLM reasoning to filter for relevance. This creates a \"best of both worlds\" system that combines semantic search, graph traversal, and intelligent reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technical Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we'll implement the Graph RAG system described in our methodology overview. The implementation follows our four-stage approach: data preparation, vector storage, query processing, and intelligent reranking.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "\n",
        "To complete this demo, you need a vector database. You can get a fully-managed Milvus vector database for free by [signing up Zilliz Cloud](https://cloud.zilliz.com/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Nir-250512).

The subgraph expansion step provides us with many potentially relevant relationships, but not all of them are equally useful for answering our specific query.

        "\n",
        "While the example in this tutorial works well with a small dataset, implementing Graph RAG in production with large-scale data requires robust infrastructure. Milvus is a distributed vector database that scales to billions, making it a trustable choice for managing large-scale vector data. Managing a self-hosted Milvus cluster can become challenging in production. If your priority is developing business logic for your RAG applications, Zilliz Cloud offers a fully-managed Milvus service that handles all the operational complexity for you:\n",

        "- **Production-Ready**: Built-in high availability and security features essential for mission-critical AI applications\n",
        "- **10x Faster Performance**: Its proprietary Cardinal vector index engine provides 10x faster performance even compared to high-performance open-source Milvus.\n",
        "- **AutoIndex**: The AutoIndex feature saving the effort of index selection and parameter tuning.\n",
        "- **Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**: Focus on your application while we handle scaling, updates, and monitoring, and pay only for what you use with flexible pricing tiers, which leads to a lower TCO compared to managing a self-hosted Milvus cluster\n",
